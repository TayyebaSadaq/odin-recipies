    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
        <li>2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
        <li>3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup pizza sauce</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>Your favorite pizza toppings (pepperoni, mushrooms, bell peppers, etc.)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Let it stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine flour, olive oil, salt, and sugar. Add the yeast mixture and stir to form a dough.</li>
        <li>Knead the dough on a floured surface until smooth and elastic, about 8-10 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, cover, and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven to heat.</li>
        <li>Punch down the dough and divide it in half. Roll out one half on a floured surface to your desired thickness.</li>
        <li>Transfer the rolled-out dough to a pizza peel or baking sheet. Spread pizza sauce over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce, then add your favorite toppings.</li>
        <li>Transfer the pizza to the preheated oven (or onto the pizza stone) and bake until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned, about 12-15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving. Repeat with the second half of the dough and remaining toppings.</li>
        <li>Enjoy your homemade pizza!</li>
    </ol>
